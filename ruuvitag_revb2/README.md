# RuuviTag Rev.B2

### TODO

* Add more clearance to battery hole (0.3mm should be fine)
* Name LED3 to LED2 in schematic
* Consider to replace LEDs with LTST-C195KGJRKT or similar double LED package
* Add optional NFC connector Molex 51281-0594 (0512810594) used in PCA10040
* Remove useless pull-up resistor from BUTTON1 (nRF52 has internal ones)
* 32MHz crystal from 3225 to 2016 size
* 32kHz crystal to FC-135 32.768KHZ Â±20PPM,9.0PF (FC-135 32.7680KA-AC3 ?)
* Remove 0ohm resistor from antenna (and consider to replace it with MM8130-2600) http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.nrf52.v1.0.0/development/dev_kit/hw_rf_meas.html?cp=1_0_2_1_7
* Board diameter from 45mm to 46mm (maybe)
* Check if it's possible to add a PCB NFC antenna (it's probably not)
* Mark C12 (connected to DEC2 pin) to not assembled (difference between PCA10036 and PCA10040)
* Mark C17 to not assembled in schematic
* C19 from 1p2 to 0p8 so that we get component count down. Probaby not assembled anyways.
* Seems that ADXL363 isn't 100% footprint compatible. We had some issues with it (used this same footprint). Confirm the footprint and probably drop the ADXL363 support.
